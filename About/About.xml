TV can be educational for children, depending on the show of course. 
When playing I got a child with paralytic abasia that was constantly upset over not being able to get education during the recovery period.
So I made this mod to remedy the situation.

This mod, based heavily on my continuation of Peladors mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2194535018]TVForPrison[/url], gives a low amount of education to children via a powered TV or radio.
Tech-level, amount of joy given by the equipment and the mood of the child affects the amount of education given.
A normal tv for a child with a decent mood should suffice to keep the educational need from falling.
